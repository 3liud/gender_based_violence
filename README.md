## Motivation for the project
Gender violence is not a common occurrence in most areas in Kenya. However, lately there has been recurring reports about how gender violence on both women and young girls. This motivated me to want to understand what some of the causes for Gender violence and other such acts are. I also wanted ot see whether it is Kenya alone or other regions experience similar issues. 
Through the work, I also found out that education is an important part in ending Gender violence.
